// I've tried following the guide carefully but I still had issues building thus...
Paul's tested guide:

Prerequisities
- Java 8 (Latest)
- Python 3.7 (Didn't check 3.8)
- Eclipse (Latest)
- Git (Latest)

Confirm Prerequisite
1. Open up Command Prompt or Powershell
2. type: "java -version"; response should be the version of Java
3. type: "python --version" (might show oldest version of python installed instead);
4. type: "git --version"

Git
- On a directory of your choosing, "git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf" // This installs the stable version of ESP-IDF

Eclipse (Same as official guide)
1. Install C/C++ perspective of Eclipse
2. Go to Help > Install New Software
3. Click Add..
4. Enter Location "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/idf-eclipse-plugin/updates/latest/"
5. Name as "Espressif IDF Plugins for Eclipse"
6. Click Ok
7. Select Espressif IDF and install.
8. Will probably be prompted to restart

Installing ESP-IDF Tools on Eclipse
1. Go to Help > Espressif IDF Tools Manager > Install Tools
2. Enter the directory where you cloned the esp-idf repository
3. Select Python version (3.7)
4. Click Ok
5. You should see the status of the installation on the Eclipse console

At this point, you are pretty much setup to build and flash firmware onto the ESP32
You should be able to follow along the official guide from here on - starting from "Create a new project using ESP-IDF Templates"

P.S. the LED on our ESP32's are on GPIO 2
